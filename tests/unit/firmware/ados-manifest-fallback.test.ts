/**
 * Parity check between the ADOS Agent firmware emitter and the embedded
 * fallback baked into the Next.js proxy route. The emitter (in the agent
 * repo) produces the canonical catalog from src/ados/hal/boards/*.yaml.
 * The Mission Control proxy carries an embedded fallback so the Flash
 * Tool stays usable when the GitHub release is unreachable.
 *
 * The fallback must be a SUBSET of the emitted catalog: every board the
 * fallback advertises must also appear upstream so that, when the
 * release manifest finally lands, no fallback-only stubs are silently
 * shadowed.
 *
 * The fixture at tests/fixtures/ados-agent-manifest.fixture.json carries
 * the snapshot of board ids the emitter currently produces. Update it by
 * hand when the agent repo's HAL board set changes. The fixture's
 * leading "_comment" field documents the procedure.
